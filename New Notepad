Code Review Notes:

1. Version Inconsistencies:

- README mentions Python 3.7+ requirement
- requirements.txt specifies versions:
  - hidapi>=0.14.0
  - tk>=0.1.0

2. Vendor/Product ID Discrepancies:

- README shows example values:
  - vendor_id = 0x4335
  - product_id = 0x0002
- keyboard_led_control.py has different values:
  - vendor_id = 0x4648
  - product_id = 0x0001

3. Dependencies:

- Code uses tkinter and hid modules
- requirements.txt correctly lists both dependencies
- tk version seems unusually low (0.1.0)

4. Documentation Accuracy:

- README accurately describes all features implemented in the code
- Command line instructions are correct
- Setup instructions are complete and match code requirements

5. Code Implementation:

- All features mentioned in README are properly implemented
- Raw HID commands are properly defined
- GUI elements match documentation

Recommendations:

1. Consider updating requirements.txt to use a more standard tkinter version
2. Align vendor/product IDs between README and code, or make it clearer these are example values
3. Consider adding error handling section in README for common connection issues
